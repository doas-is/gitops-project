## Project Overview
This project is designed to streamline the deployment and management of applications using GitOps principles. It leverages Git repositories as the single source of truth and automates the deployment process through CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes.

### Key Features:
- **Version Control**: All configurations are stored in Git.
- **Automated Deployments**: Changes in the repository trigger automated deployment workflows.
- **Security**: Built-in compliance and security checks to ensure deployments meet organizational policies.
